				<p> Within the last decade, the terms artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become buzzwords that are often used interchangeably. While AI and ML are inextricably linked and share similar characteristics, they are not the same thing. Rather, ML is a major subset of AI.
				</p>
				<p>Here’s a more in-depth look into artificial intelligence vs. machine learning, the different types, and how the two revolutionary technologies compare to one another.</p>
				<h4>What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</h4>
				<p>AI is defined as computer technology that imitate(s) a human’s ability to solve problems and make connections based on insight, understanding and intuition.</p>
                <p>The field of AI rose to prominence in the 1950s. However, mentions of artificial beings with intelligence can be identified earlier throughout various disciplines like ancient philosophy, Greek mythology and fiction stories.</p>
			</div>
            <div>
                <h4>Common AI applications:</h4>
                <p>Self-driving cars (Tesla). Personalized recommendations (Netflix, YouTube). Personal assistants (Amazon Alexa, Siri).</p>
                <h4>What is machine learning(ML)?</h4>
                <p>Machine learning (ML) is considered a subset of AI, whereby a set of algorithms builds models based on sample data, also called training data. The main purpose of an ML model is to make accurate predictions or decisions based on historical data.
                </p>
                <h4>Common ML applications:</h4>
                <p>Speech recognition. Computer vision (CV). Spam/fraud detection. Malware threat detection.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Another way ML is used is to power digital navigation systems. For example, Apple and Google Maps apps on a smartphone use ML to inspect traffic, organize user-reported incidents like accidents or construction, and find the driver an optimal route for traveling.</p>
                <h4>AI vs. ML: 3 key similarities-</h4>
                <p>AI and ML do share similar characteristics and are closely related. ML is a subset of AI, which essentially means it is an advanced technique for realizing it. ML is sometimes described as the current state-of-the-art version of AI.
                </p>
                <p>1. Continuously evolving</p>
                <p>AI and ML are both on a path to becoming some of the most disruptive and transformative technologies to date. Some experts say AI and ML developments will have even more of a significant impact on human life than fire or electricity.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>2. Offering myriad benefits</p>
                <p>Another significant quality AI and ML share is the wide range of benefits they offer to companies and individuals.</p>
                <p>3. Leveraging Big Data</p>
                <p>Without data, AI and ML would not be where they are today. AI systems rely on large datasets, in addition to iterative processing algorithms, to function properly.</p>
                <h4>AI vs. ML: 3 key differences</h4>
                <p>1. Scope</p>
                <p>AI is an all-encompassing term that describes a machine that incorporates some level of human intelligence. It’s considered a broad concept and is sometimes loosely defined, whereas ML is a more specific notion with a limited scope.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>2. Success vs. accuracy</p>
                <p>Another difference between AI and ML solutions is that AI aims to increase the chances of success, whereas ML seeks to boost accuracy and identify patterns. Success is not as relevant in ML as it is in AI applications.</p>
                <p>3. Unique outcomes</p>
                <p>Ai is a much broader concept than ML and can be applied in ways that will help the user achieve a desired outcomes. Ai also employs methods of logic, mathematics, and reasoning to accomplish its tasks, whereas ML can only learn, adapt or self-correct when it's introduced new data. In a sense, ML has more constrained capabilities than AI.</p>
                <p>ML models can only reach a predetermined outcomes, but AI focuses more on creating an intelligent system to accomplish more than just one result.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>It can be perplexing, and the differences between AI and ML are subtle. Suppose a business trained ML to forecast future sales. It would only be capable of making predictions based on the data used to teach it.</p>
                <h4>Identifying the differences between AI and ML-</h4>
                <p>Much of the progress we’ve seen in recent years regarding AI and ML is expected to continue. ML has helped fuel innovation in the field of AI.</p>
                <p>AI and ML are highly complex topics that some people find difficult to comprehend.</p>
                <p>Despite their mystifying natures, AI and ML have quickly become invaluable tools for businesses and consumers, and the latest developments in AI and ML may transform the way we live.</p>
