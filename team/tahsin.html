            <h3> A Newcomer In Web Development World</h3>
            <p>Hey, This is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to 

                introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start. 
                
                Here it goes. 
                
                My name is Tahsin.I am from Bangladesh.I am doing my B.Sc. at the Beijing Institute Of Technology.
                
                I have basic knowledge of Java, C, C++, and Python.

                I have more interest in Python as well as C programming language.

                I have a theoretical knowledge of computers.
                
                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
                
                I am a self-motivated person and talkative.
                
                I like to help others and I want to motivate my friends.
                
                In my free time, I like to learn about new things.
                
                There are four members at home, including me.
                
                My hobbies are watching different language movies, reading books, and watching Andrew Tate.
                
                I like to see the sunrise and also see the moonlight at night
                
                My strengths are I am a self-motivated person, hard-working and a quick learner.
                
                My weakness is that I am an overthinker but now, I have overcome it.
                
                That's all about me.</p>
