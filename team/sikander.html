                    <p>Ello there, my name's up there in the title. I'm a Pakistani, been in China for over 4 years and counting now. Doing my bachelors in the Beijing Institute of Technology(don't need Sherlock to deduce that lol). I've had an interest in programming from a young age, though I'm not very good at it(don't tell my mom). Computer Science is my major, and so far it has not been a breeze. Semi-fluent(read: barely) in C/C++, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript and and Lua (tried to make a game in Lua, did not end well). I usually have no idea what I am doing, but I aim to get this team to the top in this course, no matter how much sleep I lose.</p>
                    <P>Interests include gaming, reading, not dying to my own food, cycling, photography and a bunch of other stuff I have forgotten. Love technology in general and I want to be a part of the AI revolution(all hail our AI overlords)</P>
                    <p>I can't think of anything else to write, so please enjoy the only good picture of me.</p>
                    <p>Adios.</p>
