	So I’ve been living in China for about 10 years now and one would assume that means I’ve morphed into the culture and people here, which isn’t entirely wrong except the fact that I still struggle with my Chinese (Yea you read that right) but hey that is what BIT Chinese courses are for. 
 Moving on, Im a second year computer science student here and it’s my second time doing a project work based course with Mr Zhao. I’m currently in China so I’ve been lucky enough to practically work with my peers here. Last year we were challenged to make a game using C language and we were lucky enough to work our way through the failures and eventually build something that will always stay significant. The great thing about a project based course is the team work and how you  learn from your teammates and their thought processes. You learn to examine different perspectives and enhance your ideas and theirs. Since the course is online this semester it’s been a struggle to keep up with the teammates and weekly assignments but we’ve got a great team on our hands so expect nothing but something exceptional from us , Cheers!
