				<p> Once upon a time there was a foreign student who lived in a complex near the University
				with her mother. One day her grandmother gave her a very nice scholarship. That is why 
				everybody in the complex called her Little privileged Riding Hood. One day…
				</p>
				<p>Privileged: You called me mother?</p>
				<p>Mother: Yes, Little privileged Riding Hood. Your grandmother is very sick. I want you to go to her house and take her this little basket with some hot water and fruits.</p>
				<p>Privileged: Yes Mother.</p>
				<p>Mother: But don´t stop in Sanlitun, and don´t talk to strangers. Do as I say - go straight to your grandmother’s house.</p>
			</div>
            <div>
                <p>Little privileged Riding Hood ignored her Mother's request and went to Sanlitun, with the little basket for her grandmother. Along the way, she saw many beautiful clubs.</p>
                <p>Privileged: (Buys alcohol) What beautiful alcohol! I will take some to my grandmother.</p>
                <p>She left the little basket on the ground to pick up some more alcohol, when suddenly…</p>
                <p>Stranger: Good morning. Little privileged Riding Hood!</p>
                <p>Privileged:(smiling) Good morning, Mr. Stranger.</p>
                <p>Stranger: Where are you going so early?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Privileged: I am going to my grandmother´s house to take her this little basket with some Hot water and fruits (and alcohol).</p>
                <p>Stranger: Does your grandmother live far from here, Little privileged Riding Hood?</p>
                <p>Privileged: No, Mr. Stranger, she lives just across Sanlitun in the first little house in the complex - the one with the white door.</p>
                <p>Stranger: Good-bye, Little privileged Riding Hood. I hope she gets better. And look, do you see that road?</p>
                <p>Privileged: Yes, I do.</p>
                <p>Stranger: (pointing) Just follow that road and you will get to your grandmother´s house.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Little Privileged Riding Hood kept looking for alcohol disobeying her mother who told her not to stop in Sanlitun and to get to her grandmother´s house. Meanwhile, the Stranger knocked at Little Privileged Riding Hood grandmother´s house.</p>
                <p>(Knock) (knock) (knock)</p>
                <p>Grandmother: Who's there</p>
                <p>Professor: (soft voice) It´s me, grandmother, Little Privileged Riding Hood, and I brought you a basket with alcohol.</p>
                <p>Grandmother: Come in my little angel, push the door.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>As soon as the Stranger entered, he hid Little Privileged Riding Hood´s grandmother. Then he put on her nightgown, jumped into bed and waited for the student. A few minutes later 
                    Little Privileged Riding Hood arrived at her grandmother´s house. She knocked at the door.
                    </p>
                    <p>Privileged: Grandmother, it´s me, your granddaughter, Little Privileged Riding Hood. I came to bring you a little basket with some hot water and fruits (whispers) and some alcohol.</p>
                    <p>Professor: Come in my little angel, push the door.</p>
                    <p>Narrator: Little Privileged Riding Hood entered the little house. She went straight to her grandmother´s room, and in the bed there was the Professor dressed with her grandmother´s clothes.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Professor: Come in, my little angel. Rest for a while.</p>
                <p>Privileged: (looking puzzled) Grandmother…your voice sounds so ew. Is something the matter?</p>
                <p>Professor: I just have a bit of a cold.</p>
                <p>Privileged: Oh, what big ears you have, grandmother!</p>
                <p>Professor: it’s so I can hear who's eating in the class</p>
                <p>Privileged: And what big eyes you have!</p>
                <p>Professor: So I can see who's cheating</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Privileged: Oh, grandmother, and what big teeth you have.</p>
                <p>Professor:(jumping out of bed) All the better to laugh at you with! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>
                <p>You have failed ALL of your classes</p>
                <p>Mother: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You will now be forced to work in the family business forever!</p>
