				<p>It starts with the now infamous young programmer getting promoted to TEAM LEADER the next day the young programmer woke up very early as he could not sleep from excitement.
                </p>
                <p>He started preparing, how to boss around and tell people what to do, how to spot who is slaking, and so on. Then the time came, the young programmer is already at his desk checking who is late, come to realize his entire team was late.</p>
                <p>He got scared thinking "D...Did they all quit because of me" " what have I done!!!" and before he could finish his mental breakdown, his team arrived.
                </p>
			</div>
            <div>
                <p>The young programmer shouted 'WHY ARE YOU ALL SO LATE?", the lead designer replied "Ahm...didn't you get the email? work will start 30 minutes late" the young programmer was embarrassed and just said "Let's start the project".</p>
                <p>â€œEveryone just awkwardly made their way to their tables and started working, the young programmer wasted no time criticizing everyone about everything, abusing his power whenever he could. One member couldn't handle the added stress and asked for a smoke break.</p>
                <p>The young programmer simply said "Not before you finish your task", that's when the entire team stopped working, the young programmer was startled but ordered them to get back to work,.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                However they refused saying  "We won't work until he gets his smoke break". the young programmer was subsequently fired for his counterproductive behaviors and the overall decrease in morale within the company.
